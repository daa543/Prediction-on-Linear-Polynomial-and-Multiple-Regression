# Prediction-on-Linear-Polynomial-and-Multiple-Regression

### Linear Regression
In this task, I'll be using the Salary Dataset from Kaggle to apply Simple Linear Regression.

The main objective is to explore how years of experience relate to salary so that we can predict an individual's salary based on their experience.

### Polynomial Regression
This task explores the use of Polynomial Linear Regression to analyze a Kaggle dataset. Unlike simple linear regression, polynomial regression fits a curve to better capture non-linear relationships between variables.

The aim is to create and assess a model that predicts outcomes based on input features, demonstrating how polynomial regression can effectively model complex data patterns.

### Multiple Regression
This task focuses on analyzing a dataset from Kaggle using Multiple Linear Regression. The main goal is to understand how several independent variables affect one dependent variable.

By using Multiple Linear Regression, I aim to create a predictive model that accurately forecasts the target variable based on the input features. Unlike simple linear regression, which considers only one factor.

Multiple Linear Regression looks at several factors at once, allowing us to see how they collectively influence the outcome. This analysis will help us discover relationships, make predictions, and understand the importance of each variable in the dataset.
